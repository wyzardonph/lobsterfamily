<h3>
    A lobster is a   decapod crustacean,  meaning it has ten legs. They are invertebrates with a hard outer shell, called an exoskeleton, and no bones. Lobsters are related to crabs, shrimp, and barnacles.
    Lobster
    
    There are many different species of lobsters, but the most common ones are the American lobster (Homarus americanus) and the European lobster (Homarus gammarus). These lobsters can grow to be quite large, with some specimens weighing up to 40 pounds (18 kg).
    
    Lobsters live on the sea floor in shallow waters, where they hide in crevices or burrows. They are scavengers and eat a variety of things, including dead fish, worms, and clams. Lobsters are nocturnal animals, which means they are most active at night.
    
    Lobsters are a popular seafood dish. Their flesh is sweet and succulent, and they can be cooked in a variety of ways.  They are often served boiled or steamed, but they can also be grilled, baked, or broiled.</h3>
